Since this is not part of the University instance its not possible to sync between the two. The ideal solution would be to create University of Chicago Poll Everywhere accounts for Dennis, Mary, and students. Then transfer whatever data there is into the new uni accounts. 

However Mary said since the quarter has started and Prof. Chookaszian has already started teaching its best not to change stuff in the middle. Also I think they have already paid PE for this years licenses. Moving forward we reached out to Prof. Chookaszian and let him know about this and any other opportunities we have through central IT.
